# GatorAVL 

This is an implementation of a self balancing AVL Tree, which optimizes the insertion, deletion, and retrieval of any node's information. Self balancing is necessary since a skewed tree with n nodes would yield O(n) search time, whereas a balanced tree with n nodes would use binary search to traverse the tree, resulting in O(logn) for a search.
